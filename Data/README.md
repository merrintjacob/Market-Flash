# Project Data Overview

This repository contains the foundational datasets provided by **Markus**, the owner of **Marketflash**, to evaluate and optimize the company's marketing campaign performance. Initially, the data was stored in two Excel files that contained significant redundancy and inconsistencies. These files serve as the starting point for this project, helping us identify key data components to design a normalized database and efficient reporting dashboard.

## Files Included

- **`marketflash_employee_data_2023.xlsx`**  
  Contains information about employees, such as:  
  - Employee ID  
  - Name  
  - Department  
  - Supervisor relationships

- **`marketflash_marketing_data_2023.xlsx`**  
  Includes raw marketing campaign data, covering:  
  - Campaign performance metrics  
  - Channel details  
  - Location and audience segmentation

## Purpose

These files are key to achieving the following goals:

- **Data Optimization:**  
  Identify and resolve inefficiencies and redundancy within the existing dataset.

- **Designing ERD:**  
  Create a **Normalized Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to improve data structure and eliminate duplicate data.

- **Database Creation:**  
  Develop a **SQL Database** to manage and store the data efficiently, enabling better analysis and reporting.

## Next Steps

1. **Conduct Business Interviews:**  
   - Engage with Markus to gather business requirements and prioritize key performance metrics.
   
2. **Design ERD & Database:**  
   - Use the collected data to design the ERD and define table structures.  
   - Implement the SQL schema with constraints, relationships, and test data for validation.
